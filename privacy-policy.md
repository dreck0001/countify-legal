## Our Commitment to Your Privacy

At Countify, we believe that privacy is a fundamental right. We've designed our app with your privacy in mind, collecting only the information that's necessary to provide you with a great user experience. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use our Countify app.

## Information We Don't Collect

Countify is designed with privacy at its core. We want to be transparent about what we **don't** collect:

- **Personal Information**: We do not collect names, email addresses, or phone numbers.
- **Location Data**: We never track your location.
- **Usage Analytics**: We do not track how you use the app or which features you engage with.
- **Device Information**: We do not collect information about your device model, operating system, or other technical specifications.
- **Network Information**: We don't collect information about your internet connection or IP address.

## Information Stored on Your Device

Countify operates entirely on your device and stores the following information locally:

- **Counter Data**: Names, values, and settings for each counter you create.
- **App Preferences**: Your default counter settings and preferences.

This data never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to back it up through iCloud or local iOS backup.

## Third-Party Services

Countify does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. We do not share any data with third parties.

## Children's Privacy

Countify is suitable for users of all ages and does not collect personal information from anyone, including children under 13.

## Data Security

Since all data is stored locally on your device, its security is maintained by iOS's built-in security features, including device encryption when you use a passcode.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect any personal data, there's nothing for us to delete, correct, or export. Your counter data belongs entirely to you and remains on your device.
